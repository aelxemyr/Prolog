/* Chapter 8 Practical Session */

/* Now for some programming. We suggest the following mini-project, which
 * draws on all you have learned so far. Incidentally, in the Practical
 * Session at the end of Chapter 12 we will be asking to extend this
 * work even further, so do take this project seriously.
 *
 * 1. First, bring together all the things we have learned about DCGs
 * for English into one DCG. In particular, in the text we saw how to
 * use extra arguments to deal with the subject/object distinction, and
 * in the exercises you were asked to use additional arguments to deal
 * with the singular/plural distinction. Write a DCG which handles both.
 * Moreover, write the DCG in such a way that it will produce parse
 * trees, and makes use of a separate lexicon.
 *
 * 2. Once you have done this, extend the DCG so that noun phrases can
 * be modified by adjectives and simple prepositional phrases (that is,
 * it should be able to handle noun phrases such as 11the small
 * frightened woman on the table'' or ``the big fat cow under the
 * shower''). Then, further extend it so that the distinction between
 * first, second, and third person pronouns is correctly handled (both
 * in subject and object form).
